# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core machine learning
algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The goal is to understand:
- how models work internally
- how optimization behaves
- how assumptions break with real data

## Implemented Algorithms

- Linear Regression
  - MSE, MAE, Huber loss
  - Gradient descent
  - Outlier sensitivity
  - Extrapolation behavior

(more coming)

## Repository Structure

- src/ → algorithm implementations
- docs/ → detailed theory and notes
- README.md → project overview

## How to run an algorithm

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/linear_regression/linear_regression.py
