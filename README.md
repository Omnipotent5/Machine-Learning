# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core machine learning
algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The goal is to understand:
- how models work internally
- how optimization behaves
- how regularization changes learning
- how assumptions break with real data

---

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
- MSE, MAE, Huber loss
- Gradient descent
- Outlier sensitivity
- Extrapolation behavior
- Residual analysis
- Loss vs error visualization

### 2. Ridge Regression
- L2 regularization
- Gradient descent optimization
- Training loss tracking (MSE + L2)
- Feature standardization
- Bias–variance tradeoff analysis
- Weight norm vs alpha visualization
- Ridge coefficient paths (regularization paths)

(more coming)
